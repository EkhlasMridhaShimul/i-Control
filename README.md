# i-Control
It is my university second year project developed with Java. This app can act like a team viewer app. Using this app you can-
* Control your PC remotely
* Share your desktop screen on your phone

1. This app is divided into two parts-
* Server app (For desktop)
* Mobile app (Android app)

Client and server create connection using TCP socket.

## Server app
It is the server side app which needs to run on the desktop. It is developed with java in net beans with gui. It will provide an IP
address of the connected network which is needed by the client app to connect. JAVA needs to be installed on the machine to run this app.

## Client app
It is an android app which has some basic functionality to controll your remote machine. It can-
* Shutdown your desktop
* Controll your mouse
* Share your desktop screen
